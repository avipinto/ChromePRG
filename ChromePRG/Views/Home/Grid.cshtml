<h2>Showing a bug in Chrome History</h2>
<p>Let's assume this is a grid, showing a lot of data. <br />
and there is this link to add more data  @Html.ActionLink("Click me to go to the form", "RedirectWith302")
<br /><br />
NOTE: even when using a form that redirects with 303, this problem happens <br />
here is a link to a form that after post will redirect with 303: @Html.ActionLink("Click me to go to the form that redirects with 303", "RedirectWith303")
</p>

Open this site in Chrome and to the following:
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the form</li>
<li>Click on Submit</li>
</ol>
repeat the steps twice, and then, when you are at the Form -> click the Back button <br />
<b>you will have to click twice on the Back button to return to the Grid</b><br />
The More times you repeat the steps the more Back button clicks you will have to click to return to the Grid

<br /><br /><br /><br />
I hope this is not a bug and i'm missing something, but this happens only in Chrome<br />
Let me know if i'm wrong
